<!-- SITUATION -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The situation.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        Education today is using <span class="bolded">digital devices</span> as part of the curriculum with ever-growing frequency. Content is used from various sources, including the National Science Teaching Association (NSTA).
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        One of NSTA’s services is <span class="bolded">creating interactive ebooks</span> for elementary students.
    </p>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

</section>



<!-- PROBLEM -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The problem.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        As <span class="bolded">education standards change</span> many schools are facing the same problems. One sector of which is the treatment of science at the elementary level. In certain states, <span class="bolded">science is either no longer mandatory in the elementary classroom</span>, or the amount of time allotted to teaching science is decreasing.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        Naturally, teachers are looking at how they can incorporate science content into traditionally science-free subjects, such as English or social studies.
    </p>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

</section>



<!-- SOLUTION -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The solution.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        Fictional stories about science phenomena already existed, not a new idea. However, NSTA did <span class="bolded">bring something new to the market</span>. A seamless student-led exploration in narrative form. <span class="bolded">Interweaving science, mathematics, and English language learning arts</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        Not only a story, but also a teaching manual. Acting as a guide to the educator on how to incorporate the content into the classroom depending on their pedagogical goals.
    </p>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

<!-- VISION -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The vision.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        Traditionalists are comfortable with books. Technology enthusiasts don’t bat an eye at apps. So what about a web-app that emulated a book-like format? Not only would it appeal to both markets but keeping a book format is key to students’ language learning.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The result? An <span class="bolded">interactive ebook hosted on a SASS</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The interactive format allows for a multitude of things.
    </p>

    <ul id="planList">
        <li><span class="bolded">Experimentation</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Active engagement</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Look up definitions</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Assessment</span>.</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">
        The ebook would act as a foundation of learning enhanced by an educator guiding the students and enriching the learning experience.
    </p>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

<!-- TEST -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The test.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        Before launching a fully-fledged series we had to create an <span class="bolded">MVP</span> (minimal viable product). The most cost-effective way of doing this is by creating an ebook in-house.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="PortfolioImages" src="images/Testbook.jpg">

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        A group of 20 teachers at our national conference review the ebook.
        <span class="bolded">They all agree they would use it without modification</span>. But, almost none in the same way. Below are just a few ways they had in mind.

    </p>

    <ul id="planList">
        <li><span class="bolded">Embedding it directly into the curriculum</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Supplementary content for both advanced and challenged learners</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Look up definitions</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Easy-access content for students missing school</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">Both individual and class reading time</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="description">
        At this stage, our two main takeaways are:
    </p>

    <ul id="planList">
        <li><span class="bolded">1.</span> ebook needs to be robust enough for student completion without outside help; and</li>
        <li><span class="bolded">2.</span> manual needs plenty of material ensuring the educator does not feel restricted.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

<!-- VISUAL DESIGN -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The visual design.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        After the conference, we developed the test ebook into a <span class="bolded">final product with a consistent visual design</span> to be applied to every future ebook.
    </p>

     <div class="sectionImg">

<!-- BRANDING -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The branding.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        Branding this was going to be complicated... Let me explain.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        <span class="bolded">“Think Like A Scientist”</span> is a sub-series of <span class="bolded">“Kids”</span> within the larger series <span class="bolded">“eBooks+”</span> within the publication house of <span class="bolded">“NSTA”</span>. Yup. That was a lot. This might be helpful...
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        <span class="bolded">NSTA > eBooks+ > Kids > Think Like A Scientist</span>
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        To get all of these elements into the cover design three of the series are <span class="bolded">combined into one single logo</span>: the “eBooks+” logo, which already includes “NSTA”, and “Kids” emulating the print press NSTAKids series.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="SmallPortfolioImages" src="images/eBooksKidsLogo.svg">

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        “Think Like A Scientist” is treated as a badge.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="SmallPortfolioImages" src="images/ThinkLikeAScientisLogo.jpg">

    </div>


    <p class="description">
        This particular design element could and would be <span class="bolded">used on merchandise at conferences</span>. The first conference selling merchandise with this logo everything sold out the first day of a four day conference.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="printoutImg" src="images/Merchandise1.jpg">

<!-- DEVELOPMENT -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The development.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        The ebook layout is done in iBooks before sending it to development by an outside contractor: Magic Software. From there Magic creates epub3 files to be used on our SASS– NSTA eReader–<span class="bolded">available on the Playstore, Apple Store, web, and Windows Apps</span>.
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="PortfolioImages" src="images/ereader.jpg">

    </div>

    <p class="description">
        The <span class="bolded">ebooks' interactivity is integral to create a student-led experience</span>. The interactives' storylines and UI/UX are done in-house before moving on to development. The whole process from initial design to delivery is a close and on-going collaborative process between project management, designers, and engineers. 
    </p>

    <div class="sectionImg">

        <img class="PortfolioImages" src="images/interactive.jpg">

    </div>

    <div class="underlineDiv"></div>

</section>



<!-- RELEASE -->

<section class="sectionParts">

    <h3>The release.</h3>

    <p class="description">
        The first ebook, written in-house, paved the path for the rest of the series. However, unlike the first ebook, the rest are authored by elementary educators–<span class="bolded">written by teachers for teachers</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The ebooks are currently incorporated into schools' curriculum, used as supplementary content, and in home-schools. 
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        Within 3 years <span class="bolded">100+</span> schools adopted the ebooks. 
    </p>
