                <b>90% of my time</b> at conferences, <b>I spent watching teachers interact with the book</b>. During that time, <b>I noticed how instructions could be clarified</b>, simultaneously easing the narrative flow. Although adult conference attendees were not actively struggling to understand the instructions, they did take more time than I thought necessary as an adult, indicating a child–the target demographic– would have even more trouble. <b>I saw this as an opportunity</b> to clarify the instructions and make them more seamless in the story's narrative.

            <p class="description">
                After a focus group of our pilot ebook, the instruction designer and I <b>troubleshot how to improve the instructions based on feedback</b>. We wanted to ensure the user could check what they were supposed to do on each page.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Initially, we discussed if instructions should only be within the narrative text. However, <b>too many instructions would impede the flow of the story</b> and may not be necessary for repetitive interactive elements.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                <b>After the focus group</b>, I saw consistently using the hand-icon in the ebook would create a host of issues. Producing unhelpful visual clutter, visually date the look quickly, and rely on instructions in the text– which we had agreed previously would impede the narrative.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                The instruction designer and I <b>solutionized on a pop up with instructions appearing on every interactive page</b>. Next, we figured out where to place the pop-up. For the least impact on the content layout, the pop-up button went next to the page number as a separate element. The page number itself could have been the pop-up element, but since K-5 students were the target audience, <b>UI intuitiveness out-weighed style</b>. I designed a hand icon, signifying touch, and <b>following the visual queues of general interactive buttons</b>.

                After the release of the sixth ebook, <b>I implemented two changes</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                    I widened the width of the pop-ups' boxes, <b>allowing single sentence</b> instructions to be <b>easier to read</b>.

                    <p class="caption">
                        Before: pop-up boxes were often narrow covering main screen text and decreasing legibility

                </div>

                <p class="description">
                    I removed any instructions <b>insinuating right and wrong answers or extraneous information already covered in the narrative text</b> in the instruction pop-up.
                </p>

                <div class="sectionImg">

                    <p class="caption">
                        Before: pop-up box instructions had extraneous text increasing reading time. In this image the narrative text says to match the objects in the shadow, therefore it is not entirely necssary in the pop-up box instructions. Simply saying "Drag the object onto the tables" would be enough.  
                    </p>

            <p class="description">
                These <b>changes sped up and increased comprehension</b> enough of conference attendees to mark a difference.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                However, the <b>frequency</b> and <b>style</b> of embedded instructions in the narrative were <b>still inconsistent</b> between ebooks.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                There was still <b>room for improvement</b>. The next obstacle to tackle was making instructions so easy to find and understand that if someone opened a book to any page, the user would be able to know what was interactive and what they needed to do.

                From the sixth to the thirteenth release, I <b>fine-tuned standardizing embedded instructions</b>–copy I wrote and integrated.

                Due to budget constraints, we could not retroactively update previous books' instructions. However, at conferences, <b>I was able to monitor which books invoked the most questions and which ones garnered the least</b>–later releases created the least questions.
