                The Director General's office wrote a significant report available on The World Bank's online Reader and print. It assessed the World Bank's performance, departing from tradition, and instead, analyzing results beyond ratings to classify outcome levels for World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) projects.

                Even though The World Bank approached me to create four static graphs for the online report, they were not thrilled at the prospect of multiple graphs taking up a lot of screen space, especially on mobile. However, they were not sure of an alternative.

            <p class="description">
                These particular graphs are outcome ratings of The World Bank. They are all measured in percent over units of years. Using <b>interaction design principles</b> to create a graph, would allow the <b>user to compare the data silmutaneously minimizing screen space</b>.

Although a legend is usually under or to the side of a graph, since the legend labels were serving as the graph titles, I felt the top of the graph would be a better placement. The change in legend position removed the visual break that previously occurred between the graph and the caption.

                Upon <b>presentation to the stakeholders</b>, they were still concerned the trends were lost on a desktop's fullscreen as the graph stretched too much horizontally. I resolved this by not maintaining the aspect ratio and creating different ratios as the screen size changed. I also applied a maximum width preventing the graph from expanding past the point of usefulness to determine trends.

                As I <b>tweaked and tested the styles</b>, I felt the legend was hard to read due to the low line-height and center alignment. Left-aligning and adding padding resolved the readability problem, making it easier to read the legend labels one at a time.

        The <b>stakeholders</b> decided the graph needed to be blank on load as there should be no direct comparison between the graph lines as the main <b>UX goals</b> were to save screen space and get an overview of the chapter. To further guarantee no comparison, I removed the ability to toggle from a single graph line to all graph lines–as there was before.
