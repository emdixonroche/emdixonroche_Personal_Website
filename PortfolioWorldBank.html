            <p class="description">
                Upon seeing the interactivity at play, they realized the x-axis label felt redundant on the graphs with standard years but necessary on the fiscal year graph. They also worried the trend differences were not apparent enough. <b>I solved these concerns</b> by increasing the minimum and decreasing the maximum y-axis scale to exaggerate the change of the trends and removing the x-axis label on the graphs with standard years.

            <p class="description">
                Since they did not want a direct comparison of the graphs to be the main focus, they floated the idea of a blank graph upon load. <b>I explained the possibility of a user missing the graph information altogether with an initial blank load</b>. They agreed all lines should be visible upon load, but captions would only be visible upon selection of the legend items.

                During the styling process, the location of the legend continued to bother me.
