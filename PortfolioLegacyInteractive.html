                Fortunately, through NSTA conferences across the country, I directly <b>interacted with our potential customers</b>.

                Originally NSTA developed this ebook series for teacher professional and content development.

            <p class="description">
                This particular interactive is an exploration of information where the <b>user makes inferences to achieve the learning objective</b>. Therefore it is crucial the user review all information without missing screens and keeping track of thoughts without needing access to writing materials. Not only would the <b>UI need to be clear what was active versus inactive</b>, but also <b>what order they should view the screens</b>.

            <p class="description">
                The different sections look like navigation links in the initial design round, and the UI failed to differentiate between a viewed screen and a non-viewed screen.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Although a <b>menu-style navigation</b> had made sense, it created a few <b>UX issues</b>. It <b>did not successfully guide the user through the screens</b>, which was the <b>main UX goal</b>, and it did not follow the same design principles as the rest of the interactive navigation in the series style, i.e.link style versus button. In addition to this issue, the change in visual contrast on the link style navigation between viewed/viewing/unviewed was not strong enough, ergo still did not guide the user.
            </p>

            <div class="sectionImg">

            <p class="description">
                Based on conversations with teachers at conferences, we knew both teachers and students did not want to use pen/pencil and paper when reading/interacting with our ebooks.

            <p class="description">
                We added a title bar with a question mark, checkmark, and cross available at any time. Initially, we colored in these checks: blue for uncertain; green for yes; and red for no. However, the whole <b>internal review team felt the use of color associated with right and wrong</b>.

                The <b>internal team found the interactive to be too exploratory</b>. We knew middle or high schoolers without adult guidance might use the interactive. So we <b>added some structure to the exploration</b>, guiding the user through the interactive, allowing them to move backward and forwards as they wished without potentially missing screens with information. For example, after the first iteration, "Previous" buttons were added, avoiding the user navigating back to the main menu every time to review information.

        The <b>interactive was exploratory but not to the level where the user felt lost or confused</b>.

    <p class="description">
        We added <b>enough UX to guide the user through the information but still giving them the flexibility</b> to review screens whenever they wanted to.
