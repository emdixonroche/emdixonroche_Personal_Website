                Originally, NSTA developed this ebook series as professional and content development for teachers. However, in conference conversations, it became abundantly clear many teachers used and wanted to use the interactives with their students either as a class activity or as self-guided learning.

            <p class="description">
                Out of the entire 200 product series, <i>CSI: Food Safety</i> was the most challenging. Users had to make <b>educated inferences</b> or guesses about the provided information to achieve the <b>learning objective</b>–successful detective work.

                    the navigation did not follow the same <b>design principles</b> as the <b>navigation style</b> in the rest of the ebook series (e.g. link versus button).

                Based on <b>qualitative research at conferences</b>, teachers and students did not want to use pen/pencil and paper when reading/interacting with our ebooks. The user needed to keep track of their predictions and then access it independent of which tab they were on.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                To keep track, I added a title bar with various color-coded <b>icons</b> that could be accessed at any time throughout the book.
            </p>

            <ul id="planList">
                <li>
                    question mark (blue).
                </li>
                <li>
                    checkmark (green).
                </li>
                <li>
                    x mark (red).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="description">
                Through <b>A/B testing</b>, the <b>internal review team</b> concluded that the use of color created an association between correct and incorrect.

            <p class="description">
                In the <b>first iteration</b>, the text went off-screen, and it was not obvious you needed to scroll right to see the rest. There were a few instances where the sentence was incomplete, providing an implication that the user would need to scroll. However, a few screens had a sentence end at the bottom right of the screen, giving no indication there was more text.

                A scrollbar was added to the <b>second development iteration</b>. However, the scrollbar only appeared when the user tried to scroll. Again, this did not fix the issue.

            <p class="description">
                On the <b>third development round</b>, the scrollbar was visible at all times.

<!-- EXPLORATION VERSUS GUIDED EXPLORATION -->

                Exploration versus Guided Exploration
            </h3>

            <p class="description">
                Through <b>usability testing</b> and experience with how middle or high schoolers might use the interactive without adult guidance, the <b>internal team</b> found the interactive to be too exploratory.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                More <b>structure</b> to the exploration was added, guiding the <b>user</b> through the interactive and allowing them to move backward and forwards without missing screens. For example, after the first iteration, "Previous" buttons were added, avoiding the user navigating back to the main menu every time to review information.
            </p>

        Final Product and Outcome
    </h3>

    <p class="description">
        The interactive was exploratory without the potential for getting stuck in loops that led to frustration.
    </p>

    <p class="description">
        The UX guided the user through the information while giving them flexibility to review at their discretion, resulting in learning objectives being met.
