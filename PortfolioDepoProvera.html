                The Opportunity
            </h3>

            <p class="description">
                After hearing a nurse <b>complain</b> about a <b>repetitive</b> and <b>time-consuming process</b>, I interviewed other nurses about the same pain points. They said they hated having to look up the date range for patient follow-up injections of Depo-Provera using a printed or digital PDF from 1999. This PDF was sometimes laminated, sometimes not, and sometimes had to be looked up on the computer.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p class="description">
                Nurses had numerous patients throughout the day, and they said it was annoying to be always looking for the PDF or online. Each time they looked up dates throughout the day, the process felt <b>frustrating</b> and <b>inefficient</b>. They could not believe an app or website did not already exist to solve this, and the app that did exist did not satisfy their needs.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                I saw the potential to create a <b>product</b> with an immediate <b>value proposition</b> for an existing client base–a web-based calculator to replace the PDF.

            <ol class="numberedList">

            <p class="description">
                Although the nurses liked the idea of an app-based solution, they really needed a way to access the calculator while they were on their computer.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                By researching how nurses were looking up and saving the date range, a couple of solutions immediately became apparent.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Ideation led me to conclude that two solutions would best solve their problem:
            </p>

            <ol class="numberedList">
                <li>
                    A web-app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Google Chrome extension.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="description">
                The Chrome extension idea came from what browsers the nurses and their peers used. Although everyone I spoke to used Google Chrome, it was unreasonable to extrapolate this to the entire user population. Hence, the need for an additional cross-platform web app.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                As a healthcare product, I also had to ascertain whether there would be any potential HIPPA issues. Since no patient data was stored or entered, only generic dates, I concluded that the calculator didn’t have any HIPPA hurdles.

                Leveraging my scientific illustration experience with The Smithsonian Institute (<a href="/creative.html">example illustrations</a>), I first created the <b>logo</b> to inform the rest of the <b>brand</b>. The two main words associated with the calculator are "injection" and "date." Lucky for me, these are two visual elements: a hypodermic needle and a calendar.

                My two competitors did not have clear branding. It was a clear opportunity for my product to stand out. By <b>branding my product</b> and therefore giving it an <b>identity</b>, it would have <b>cross-platform recognition</b>.

                The main <b>design requirement</b> was "simple," but I felt a close second was "approachable." I made sure the
                needle looked as friendly as possible and used a calendar representation. During the <b>design iteration</b>, I
                saw a neat opportunity for the injection drop to represent the day of the injection.
