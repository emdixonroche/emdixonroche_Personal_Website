                Nurses administering Depo-Provera need to look up the date range the patient needs to come back for
                their follow-up injection. All nurses I spoke to and the nurses they knew, look up the date range on a
                <b>PDF of the Depo-Provera perpetual calendar in a table format</b>, either printed out or online. Nurses look
                up the dates multiple times a day, <b>wasting a lot of time</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                A nurse I knew in passing <b>complained about this time-consuming process</b>, and <b>I suggested developing a
                simple calculator replacing the printout</b> shared by nurses or looking up the PDF online.

                The <b>consensus was universal</b> after <b>consolidating feedback</b> from local nurses. They needed a <b>simple
                calculator</b> where they put in the <b>date of the injection</b> and were given the <b>date range</b> in a particular

            <p class="description">
                <b>None</b> of the nurses I spoke to <b>used the Depo calendar app</b>. They all used and shared laminated PDFs. They
                said it was <b>annoying</b> to be always <b>looking for the PDF or online</b>. Each time they looked up dates
                throughout the day, the <b>process was frustrating and inefficient</b>. They <b>could not believe an app or
                website did not already exist</b> that did this, and the <b>app that did exist did not satisfy their needs</b>.

                </p>

            </div>

            <p class="description">
                Once I <b>started digging</b> into how the nurses looked up the date range and what they did with it, a <b>few
                solutions became immediately apparent</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                The <b>goal of looking up the date</b> of the injection is to <b>input the date range</b> of the follow-up appointment
                into patient forms on their computer. Ideally, they <b>do not need their phone</b>, and they can <b>copy and paste
                in one go</b> date range directly into the patient form.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                Although the <b>nurses wanted an app</b> as their solution, in reality, they <b>just needed a way to access the
                calculator</b> while they were <b>on their computer</b>‚Äìindicating a web-app would best suit their needs. I
                <b>surveyed</b> the nurses on <b>what browsers they</b> and their peers <b>use</b>. Although all nurses I spoke to <b>used
                Google Chrome, some don't and, more importantly, won't</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                I <b>concluded a web-app accessible on any browser</b> and a <b>Google chrome-extension</b> would work best for the
                majority of users.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                As a <b>healthcare product</b>, I had to ascertain whether there would be <b>any potential HIPPA issues</b>. The <b>calculator</b>
                would <b>not have any HIPPA hurdles</b> since no patient data was stored or entered, only generic dates.
